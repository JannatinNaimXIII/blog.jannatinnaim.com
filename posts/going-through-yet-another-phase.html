        <h1>Going Through Yet Another Phase</h1>
        <p>
            I'm easily influenced by the content I consume. If I watch something joyful my entire day goes by with me
            feeling happy about anything I do. When I watch something sad, I just keep thinking about it for the rest of
            the day and then that feeling sticks around for a while. God knows how many times I've tried to rebrand
            myself after watching yet another show that sparked some new feeling inside me. This is no different.
            However, I'm going to document how far I go and then in the future when I get yet another emotional
            outburst, I'll look back and say, "Yeah, I can do better."

            Just so I have some context the next time I'm reading this, Attack on Titan aired its last episode. The
            world will probably move on within the next 2 days, and so will. Even so, I'd like to write down how I feel
            at this very moment. I'm devastated to say the least. I knew what was going to happen as I had already
            watched a review of the manga and its ending. So, it wasn't a surprise to see the ending in the anime. It
            did however not feel the same as watching the review and reading the manga panels. It felt painful. In the
            context of the world Attack on Titan is set in, why did one boy have to endure all that. The fate of
            humanity all in the hands of one single man. I don't know much about the manga and how things were depicted
            there nor did I do an in depth analysis of the anime. It's just me saying what I feel like saying. I'm
            definitely going to re-watch the entire series just to go through the story one more time before I move on.
            This is an experience of a lifetime, and I'm going to enjoy it as much as I can.

            This is what's going to kickstart the new phase I'll go through for who knows how many days. I feel sad.
